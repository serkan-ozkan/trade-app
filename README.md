Notes:

You can use the my database on elephantsql. The url is in config/database.js.
If you want to set your own database you can use the seed files to populate it.

I have never write node.js before. Since it was my first project I could not follow all best practices. Like I would out the database link in env variables etc. But since it was a demo and I have limited time I left it open.

Postman Collection is in TradeApp Test Collection.postman_collection.json
